Create a complete, single HTML file for a web app called "TrendPulse" that allows users to predict and vote on trends.

Requirements:

üîß General:
- All code must be in one single .html file (no external files).
- Use embedded CSS (<style>) and JavaScript (<script>).
- The app must be fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- Color scheme: neon purple (#A100FF), dark navy (#0F1021), and white (#F5F5F5).
- Use Google Fonts (Inter or Outfit).

üåê Use CDNs for the following:
- Firebase SDK (Authentication and Firestore)
- Chart.js for vote visualization
- Google Fonts
- Optional: Feather Icons or Heroicons via CDN

‚öôÔ∏è Core Functionality:
1. Google Sign-in using Firebase Authentication
2. Form to submit a new trend (title, description, tags)
3. Display list of existing trends from Firestore, sorted by vote count
4. Each trend has a "Vote" button (limit: 3 votes per user per day)
5. Real-time update of vote count when voted
6. Leaderboard or chart section using Chart.js
7. Show creator name and created date
8. All data stored and retrieved from Firebase Firestore
9. Store user‚Äôs voted trend IDs per day to prevent duplicate voting

üìå Notes:
- Include Firebase project initialization via <script> tag
- Use Firestore in test mode or mock data if Firebase config is missing
- Output must work directly when opened in the browser
- No Python or server-side code ‚Äì only client-side JS
- Keep the HTML organized and readable

üëâ The final output should be a single HTML file that I can open in Chrome or upload to static hosting (like Firebase Hosting or Namecheap) and use it immediately.
